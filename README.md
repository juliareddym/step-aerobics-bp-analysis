# Step Aerobics and Blood Pressure Analysis

## Project Description
This repository contains my first internship and academic research project completed in 2018 as part of my Bachelor of Physiotherapy program. The project analyzes the immediate impact of a single step-aerobics exercise session on heart rate and blood pressure in pre-hypertensive college students.

## Problem Statement
Pre-hypertension in young adults often goes unnoticed. This study examines whether a short aerobic exercise session can produce immediate, measurable changes in cardiovascular indicators.

## Study Design
- Study Type: Quasi-experimental (Pre-test vs Post-test)
- Sample Size: 100 college students
- Age Group: 17–25 years
- Measurements:
  - Heart Rate
  - Systolic Blood Pressure
  - Diastolic Blood Pressure
- Time Points:
  - Before exercise
  - Immediately after exercise
  - After 5 minutes
  - After 15 minutes
  - After 30 minutes

## Data Collection
Blood pressure and heart rate were measured using standard clinical instruments. Data was manually recorded and later tabulated in Excel for analysis. Statistical validation was performed using SPSS (ANOVA).

## Key Insights
- Heart rate increases immediately after exercise and gradually returns to baseline.
- Systolic blood pressure decreases immediately after exercise and normalizes within 30 minutes.
- Diastolic blood pressure follows a similar post-exercise trend.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data collection and validation
- Descriptive statistics
- Time-series comparison
- Statistical analysis (ANOVA)
